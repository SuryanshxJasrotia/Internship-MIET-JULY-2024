// STL : It is collection of library/algorithm , function , andd other component/data structure.
// simplify/development the c++ programming.


//COntainer : It is used to store some data inn sequential manner. To simplify your requirement.


//seq. container
//simple array without stl -it doesnt have predefined functions & diff synatx

//Array- 1> Optimization
//       2> No need to write complete logic/code is short
//       3> Data type can be decide at run time
//       4> Easy to maintain data inside array
// Disadvantage :
//       1> It is in static nature
//       2> 
//Vector- 1> It is in dynamic nature
//List- 
//Dequeue
//methods
//1> Size
//2> Capacity
//3> Push_back
//4> Pop_back
//5> at
//6> front
//7> end
//8> empty
//9> begin
//10> swap
//11> sort
//12> erase
//13> clear
//14> push_front

//Satck 
//Push
//pop
//Peek -it display top element
